# LMAO

LMAO or **Library for Machine learning And Optimization** is projected to be a library for training machine learning alogrithms (including deep learning) and optimizing them for C programs.

It would be a libray written in C and for C.

This project is meant to be a refresher for machine learning algorithms and mathematical optimization and by NO means is complete at any point.
